# Flappy Bird Neuroevolution

This program uses a custom made neural network library to train flappy birds to jump at the right time to avoid hitting pipes.
Each generation, the birds that got the best score have a higher chance of going to the next generation while also reproduction, passing their genes to their children.
Doing this a bunch of times will, after a while, have birds that can perfectly play the game.

This project runs on JavaScript using the p5.js library.
